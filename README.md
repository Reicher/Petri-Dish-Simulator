Petri-Dish-Simulator
====================

The life on a petri dish up close! The idea is to show bacteria live, die and evolve on a Petri dish!
This is my first take on java and the JFSML library (http://jsfml.org/).

Ideas:
* Bacteria multiply by splitting, creating a clone (but sometimes it's a bit mutated)
* Bacteria have different features like Size, color, outer-shell thickness etc. 
* Bacteria need to eat nutrients find laying around on the dish, this grows back slowly.
* Bacteria have energy that can be used to live, move, eat, split.
* Time is a variable that can be speeded up. 
* GRAPHS loads of graphs. Graphs are awesome.
