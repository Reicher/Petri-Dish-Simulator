Petri-Dish-Simulator
====================

Darwinism on a plate! A few bacteria with random genome is placed on a Petri dish. The bacteria look for food and split themselves when feeling healthy enough. Mutations can occur when splitting causing some more favorable Traits to be passed on after many generations of bacteria. 

This is my first take on java and the JFSML library (http://jsfml.org/).

Controls:
* 'P' = Pause


Next To do's:
* Completely re-organize Bacteria, create a "population" class
* Print out more in the infoPanel
* Make the dish area movable with pan and zoom.
* Fine tune how the genes should interact with speed, eating pace etc.
* Refactor code...
