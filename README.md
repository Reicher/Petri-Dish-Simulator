Petri-Dish-Simulator
====================

Darwinism on a plate! A few bacteria with random genome is placed on a Petri dish. The bacteria look for food and split themselves when feeling healthy enough. Mutations can occur when splitting causing some more favorable Traits to be passed on after many generations of bacteria. 

This is my first take on java and the JFSML library (http://jsfml.org/).

Controls:
* 'P' 		= Pause
* 'Scroll' 	= Camera Zoom
* 'Left/Right'  = Camera Pan


Next To do's:
* Add limits to the camera pan
* Prevent the camera zoom to fuck up
* Be able to select a bacteria and see info about it
* Fine tune how the genes should interact with speed, eating pace etc.
* Refactor code...
